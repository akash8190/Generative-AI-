# Welcome to the era of machine learning and deep learning in 2023!Â¶
Exploring the state of machine learning today and how it affects various fields is crucial as we move forward into the future. Machine learning's potential for growth is very encouraging. Algorithms have advanced significantly, becoming simpler, more approachable to understand, and more potent than before. Machine learning is dramatically altering our lives, from the emergence of deep learning and generative AI to ground-breaking uses in healthcare, finance, transportation, and retail. Let's embark on a journey through the impact, learnings, newest trends, predictions, and issues to uncover the huge potential of machine learning in the present and the future.

Over the past few years, deep learning has developed, and its algorithms are now widely used in a variety of industries. It utilizes artificial intelligence neural networks (ANNs) to carry out intricate computations on vast volumes of data, basing its operation on the structure and operation of the human brain. Generative AI, also referred to as creative AI or art AI is one of these potent toolkits that makes use of deep neural networks. It recognizes patterns and structures within the existing data to produce unique and original content that may include text, visual, audio, code, 3D models, or other types of data. For training, generative AI models can use a variety of learning strategies, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. As a result, businesses are now able to quickly build foundational models using a vast amount of unlabeled data. The idea of foundation models is not new; well-known CNNs like Resnet-50 were initially introduced in 2015. DeepMind's Alpha Code (GoogleLab), ChatGPT, GPT-4, DALL-E, Google Bard, Bing AI, Github Copilot, Synthesia, MidJourney, Jasper, and Stable Diffusion are some of the top generative AI technologies. And ChatGPT evolved into OpenAI's most widely used product to date, launching ChatGPT Plus, a pilot paid subscription, in March 2023.

The vast majority of well-liked generative AI technologies focus on the creation of images. Text input is used by generative AI systems as the foundation for creating graphics in two, three, and even four dimensions. It can produce incredibly accurate portraits of people. You may be surprised to learn that generative AI cannot draw hands, despite its achievements. And it is the most challenging setback in AI. Making avatars is one of the most popular applications of AI picture production and TikTok is among the most well-liked platforms for sharing examples of generative AI. You can even become a superhero, a royal king or queen, or a mermaid with the use of generative AI technologies. The AI-generated QR code, which replaces the outdated black and white QR code with visually attractive ones, is another new trend. Hugging Face has made a free AI QR code generator available for this purpose. Investment in generative AI has already reached over two billion dollars, up 425 percent from 2020. Additionally, generative AI is widely regarded as the most advanced technology over the next 50 years, with many scientists and experts even referring to it as an age-reversing technology!

# Key Requirements of Generative AI
The following essential conditions must be met by generative models to be widely used in practical applications:

High-generation quality is needed for numerous applications, particularly those that deal directly with those using it.
A strong generative model should be able to effectively record variations without compromising generation performance if the training data includes a complicated or significant amount of variability.
Easy and quick generation is necessary for many interactive applications, including real-time photo editing.
